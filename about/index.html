    <div class="infopara">
      I attended <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> (BSCS 2019). I attended high school at
      the <a href="https://www.amsacs.org/">Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School</a>. My education prior to that 
      is confusing and likely irrelevant to the person reading this.
