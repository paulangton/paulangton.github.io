          My writing pieces produced during the semester demonstrate that I have
          met the short term learning goals set out for me by the Northeastern University
          Department of English. This essay will provide insight into my writing
          process and outline specific sections
          of my writing which demonstrate having met the aforementioned goals.
          Additionally, this essay will discuss the degree to which I have met
          my own writing goals. In the long term I hope to produce work of scientific interest,
          which makes the Literature Review of particular interest.
