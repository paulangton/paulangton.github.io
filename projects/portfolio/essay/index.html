          My writing pieces produced during the semester demonstrate that I have
          met the short term learning goals set out for me by the Northeastern
          University English Department. This essay will provide insight into
          my writing process and outline specific sections of my writing which
          demonstrate having met the aforementioned goals.  Additionally, this
          essay will discuss the degree to which I have progressed according my
          own writing goals, specifically my goal of producing work of
          scientific interest.

      <div class=sectiontitle>sourcing and citing</div>
      <p class="infopara"> 

      The writing program goals place heavy emphasis on the students' ability to
      evaluate sources and cite them effectively in cohesive writing pieces,
      appearing in at least 4 separate goals (5,6,8,9). The additions to the
      Wikipedia article on State Space demonstrate my ability to both evaluate
      and cite sources effectively. Source additions include multiple types of
      media from an array of publishers. Among them are open access computer
      science lectures from UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon, and a chess diagram
      from another Wikipedia article. Each source was carefully evaluated for
      its creative licensing policy, reputation, and accessibility. During this
      process, aconflict arose when I attempted to use an image of Pacman from
      the lectures in the article. Unfortunately Wikipedia does not allow the
      use of copyrighted information on its pages without special permission so
      I was unable to use it. Through this I learned the difference between the
      use of copyrighted material for educational versus informational purposes,
      and thus the importance of evaluating sources and their content. 
      
      </p>
      <p class="infopara"> 

      The importance of sources and citations is immediately obvious in any
      scientific research. Any good paper contains citations to a minimum of 5
      other papers. If I am to produce high quality research, I must learn to
      cite and evaluate sources, which I did effectively in the Wikipedia
      project. 

      </p>
      

      <div class=sectiontitle>content and style</div>
      <p class="infopara">

      Writing and style is emphasized in at least 3 of the program's writing
      goals (1,2,3), and is the weakest component of my writing, which often
      reverts to a formal, stiff, repetitive sentence structure when presented
      with a challenge. This is especially clear in the Project 1 essay, whose
      tone is meant to be casual and whose audience is my peers. Instead it
      overdresses to a pool party.

      <blockquote> 
          The first concept I ever struggled with in CS was that of
          recursion, or the invocation of a function A inside A itself.  It is
          an intrinsically confusing concept because there are few parallels in
          the real world. In general, objects in our world cannot contain
          themselves. The concept finally clicked in a lecture in Olin Shiversâ€™
      Fundies I class.

      As seen in the above quote, it is far too structured, the tone is
      insufferably stuffy, and the content too basic to excuse the repetitive
      sentence structure.

      Project 2 demonstrates significant development in ability to adjust tone
      for intended audience, and in varying sentence structure.
